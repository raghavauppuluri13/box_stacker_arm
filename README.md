# box_stacker_arm

This is my first full-stack robotics project!

- This robot can pick-and-place boxes in a predefined locations using a 4DOF inverse kinematics algorithm. 
- The CAD design is from this [HowToMechatronics video](https://youtu.be/_B3gWd3A_SI) and I made a some edits to the gripper and made the electronics housing.
